# Bike Share Program Proposal For Des Moines, Iowa

The purpose of this project is to show that Des Moines, Iowa is an excellent location to start a bike-sharing program. (Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_15955439746730/NYCvsDM?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) to view the project on Tableau Public.) New York City (NYC) already has a successful CitiBike bike-sharing program and although the demographics of Manhattan Borough (MB; the epicenter of the program) and Des Moines (DM) are clearly different, DM has features that make it a great city for a bike-sharing program. These include bicycling-compatible weather, pre-existing infrastructure (bike lanes, trails, and park lands), economic prosperity and a thriving culture. 

### Demographics
NYC has been called the financial and cultural capital of the world, so not surprisingly, the population of MB (1,628,707) is much greater than DM (214,237) as is the median household income (MB: $82,459 vs. $52,251). However, the age and gender breakdown of the populations are similar. Gender is almost 50:50 (male:female) for both, whereas DM does have more 6-17 year-old residents (11% more than MB) (United States Census Bureau, 2019).

Differences in demographics has implications for a bike-share program in DM. Whereas NYC's large population resulted in 2,344,224 Citi Bike rides in August 2019 alone (citibike, 2019), DM's smaller population will likely result in fewer uses. This could be a possible challenge for a DM program. NYC CitiBike data showed that the majority (65% or more) of users are male. Since gender breakdown is roughly 50:50 for both locations, it might be expected that the users in DM would also be mainly male. CitiBike data also showed a small correlation where younger riders (23 years-old and younger) and 50 year-olds tend to have longer rides compared to other ages (18-23 min and 36 min vs. ~15 min, respectively). Age breakdown is similar for MB and DM; thus a DM program would also be expected to benefit from younger riders. DM does have more 6 to 17 year-old residents (11% more). While this fact may not be advantageous to a DM program at the present, a young and fit ridership within the next 5-10 years does bode well for the longterm goals of a bike-sharing program. 

### Climate
The climate for DM and NYC are similar. DM has colder average temperatures in autumn and winter (autumn: ~5 degrees F colder; winter: ~10 degrees F colder). Also, DM tends to have more snow in the seasons where NYC would be experiencing more rain. For example, whereas DM has anywhere from 0.4 to 4.2 inches more snow in autumn and winter, NYC has 4.8 and 7 inches of more rain in autumn and winter, respectively (National Weather Service, 2010). Irregardless, the months of operation for a bike-sharing program would be similar for both cities e.g. May to the end of October. 

### Bicycling Infrastructure
DM already has great infrastructure in place for bicycling. There are designated bike lanes, many trails along the rivers, and abundant park land along these trails (Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization). DM is more abundant in greenspaces than NYC, which tends to have small, discrete and scattered parks (discounting Central Park) (NYC Bike Maps). DM also already has a vibrant bicycling community. For example, it is one of the overnight stops for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (RAGBRAI), one of the largest bike-touring events in the world (Catches Des Moines, 2020). Thus, residents are already inculcated with cycling culture. 

### Transportation
Whereas NYC has an extensive public transit system consisting of subways and bus routes (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2020), DM has a bus-only transit system. This may be an advantage to a DM bike-share program, since bicycling could become a major mode of transportation if the program was in place. 

### Economy & Culture
Finally, DM is an economically and culturally thriving city, and therefore a great location for a new business venture. It is home to many well-known insurance companies e.g. Principal Financial Group, EMC Insurance and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield to name a few. DM is also a poltically-relevant city as it is a campaigning stop for U.S. presidential elections (Forbes, 2020). It is culturally-vibrant, evidenced by its nationally-acclaimed festivals (Iowa State Fair, Des Moines Art Festival, and World Food & Music Festival) and Downtown Farmer's Market. It is home to the Des Moines Symphony and Ballet Des Moines, and to many professional minor league sports teams: the Iowa Clubs (baseball), Iowa Barnstormers (football), Iowa Wild (hockey), and Iowa Wolves (basketball) (Catches Des Moines, 2020).

In short, NYC CitiBike data provides an example of a successful location for a bike-share program. As DM contains a young population, compatible weather, pre-existing bicycling infrastructure and culture, and is an economically and culturally-thriving community, DM would be a great location to implement a new bike-sharing program.
